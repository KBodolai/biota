Worked example: part 1
======================

In this worked example we'll run through an example based on an area of Southeastern Tanzania called Kilwa District (Fig). This is a location where the University of Edinburgh coordinates a network of forest plots where we have good data on aboveground biomass.

In this section we'll use ``biota`` to download ALOS mosaic data for the Kilwa region.

Downloading data

In short
--------

The download script is stored in ``biota/download.py``, and has a command line interface. The ``biota`` tool is at present limited to using the ``--large`` 5x5 degree tiles, but will shortly be shifted to use 1x1 degree tiles.

Kilwa District is found in the large tile 35 longitude, -5 latitude.
